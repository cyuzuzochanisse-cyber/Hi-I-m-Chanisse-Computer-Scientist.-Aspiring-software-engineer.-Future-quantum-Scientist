This project was all about addressing the problem of students in Rwanda who don't get to go to school due to the lack of employment that affects their mothers and makes them unable to provide school fees. We came up with an idea to build an app to provide the mothers with a platform where they can acquire relevant digital and financial literacy skills to give them an opportunity to land good jobs. This app also enables them to access loans when in need and also has an option to post products for selling for those who have the talent to make valuable home-made products but nowhere to show for it. We envisioned that this idea- if put into action- would have a great impact on not only the economy of Rwanda but would also improve the work force of the whole country.
